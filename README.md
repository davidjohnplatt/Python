This a repository for some python stuff I have been playing with.  Some of
the  more intereting ones are:

fotofiler - copies photographs into a YYYY/MM/DD directory structure based 
on their exif date taken data.

nMapper - runs on linux and scans a subnet.  A new python program called
hostnmapper is produced which targets hosts found for addtional scans.

pinger - pings all hosts in a subnet.  results are sent to the /tmp directory

copyTree - duplicates a directory tree in the target location.  The command 
line version is working now.  still working on the gui version

RBCloader - some code in here for loading csv's into a mySQL database.
